Execution Time vs. Filesize:

Filesize  | Time (s)
-----------------------
1 MB      | 0.745s
10 MB     | 2.638
105 MB    | 26.546
1 GB      | 261.437

The trend in the data shows that the program takes roughly 1/4 of a second per megabyte of data, meaning the relationship is
directly proportional. The reasoning is that the files are read and written in chunks, so adding more data really just adds
more iterations of reading and writing.
